# Gradient descent learning with multiple inputs

**An empty network with multiple inputs**
```{python}
def w_sum(a,b):
    assert(len(a) == len(b))
    
    output = 0 
    
    for i in range(len(a)) :
        output += (a[i] * b[i])
        
    return output
    
weights = [0.1 , 0.2, -.1]

def neural_net(input, weights):

    pred = w_sum(input, weights)
    
    return pred
```
  
**Predict and Compare**

```{python}
toes = [8.5, 9.5, 9.9, 9.0]
wlrec = [0.65, 0.8, 0.8, 0.9]
nfans = [1.2, 1.3, 0.5, 1.0]

win_or_lose_binary = [1, 1, 0, 1]

true_pred = win_or_lose_binary[0]

input = [toes[0], wlrec[0], nfans[0]]

pred = neural_net(input, weights)

error = (pred - true_pred) ** 2

delta = pred - true
```

**Learn calc each weight_delta**
```{python}
def ele_mul(number, vector):
    
    output = [0, 0, 0]
    
    assert(len(output) == len(vector))
    
    for i in range(len(vector)):
        output[i] = number * vector[i]
    return output

input = [toes[0], wlrec[0], nfans[0]]

pred = neural_net(input, weight)

error = (pred - true_pred) ** 2

delta = pred - true_pred

weight_deltas = ele_mul(delta, input)
```

**Learn updating the weights **  
```{python}
input = [toes[0], wlrec[0], nfans[0]]

pred = neural_net(input, weight)
error = (pred - true_pred) ** 2
delta = pred - true_pred

weight_deltas = ele_mul(delta, input)

for i in range(len(weights)):
    weights[i] -= alpha * weight_deltas[i]
print("Weights: "  + str(weights))
print("Weights Deltas:" + str(weight_deltas))
```
